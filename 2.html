<h1 margin-left:"50px">Hey...</h1>
<p>To my Dearest,<br>
To think about you, my mind is popping up with so many thoughts that I don’t know which <br>
one to put first. Well to trace back our journey, its all filled with only laughter ,<br>
 with everyone’s smiling face while squeezing ourselves in those two benches and <br>
leaving you hanging always...  sorry about that.Though we met up late, <br>
our friendship has been pure and we haven’t fallen back in understanding each<br>
other. Throughout the years we have faced many difficulties silently, evolving<br>
 into great people. Away from home, and landing with people who feel like home,<br>
I feel great and should thank you for beingthere. I am myself when I am with you ,<br>
 true and honest and just like how I am with my family. Oh right!<br>
You are actually my family.<br>I was super excited to join this family clan and be your ‘precious ’ <br>
daughter and you are Mummy for a reason! Taking care of others , helping at whatever time asked,<br>
 0% impurity ,harmless and pure at heart and always supporting people.<br>
 Always staying positive and telling “mass pannidlam” , do you know how assuring and <br>
encouraging those words are?!!<br>The way you laugh covering your mouth, the way you brush your<br>
 hair off, your walking, your biting the nails , your saying ‘oookaaay’…and I can keep going on...<br>
I know this sounds like I have a crush on you..and lets say its true  .<br>
Thanks for everything and hope this day is really awesome. May your life grant you with all the things<br>
you wish for and keep you happy always. Even if it is not, I am there for you don’t forget that.<br>
P.S Thanks for the panda bear as well (it is my best hugging pillow)<br>
From,<br>
Your Dear Friend</p>
